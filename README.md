is critical for advancing our understanding of generalization    
We believe that our model sometimesimproves upon this baseline NDPP due to the use of a simpler kernel decomposition with fewerparameters, likely leading to a simplified optimization landscape.

实验表述: In the experimental part of the paper we use the developed method on models generated by several well-known machine learning algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data sets.   
不是最火最主流的研究领域怎么说: In the last decade, simplified vine copula models have been an acive area of research.  
We extend this these approaches and compare them in an extensive simulation study and a real data application.
